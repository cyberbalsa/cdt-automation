- [ ] Run `tofu init` successfully
- [ ] Review planned changes with `tofu plan`
- [ ] Deploy infrastructure with `tofu apply`
- [ ] Verify resources created in OpenStack dashboard
- [ ] Note down floating IP addresses

### Ansible (Configuration)
- [ ] Navigate to `ansible/` directory
- [ ] Update `inventory.ini` with correct IP addresses
- [ ] Test connectivity to Windows servers
- [ ] Test connectivity to Linux servers
- [ ] Run complete setup with `ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yml`

## ‚úÖ Verification & Testing

### Infrastructure Verification
- [ ] All VMs visible in OpenStack dashboard
- [ ] All VMs have floating IPs assigned
- [ ] Can SSH to Linux servers using floating IPs
- [ ] Can RDP to Windows servers using floating IPs

### Domain Setup Verification
- [ ] Domain controller (10.10.10.21) accessible
- [ ] Windows servers joined to CDT.local domain
- [ ] Linux servers joined to CDT.local domain
- [ ] Domain users created successfully

### SSH Access Testing
- [ ] Can SSH using domain credentials: `ssh jdoe@CDT.local@<linux-ip>`
- [ ] Domain admin users have sudo access
- [ ] All 5 test users can authenticate

## üéì Learning Exercises

### Beginner Challenges
- [ ] Change the number of Windows servers and redeploy
- [ ] Change the number of Linux servers and redeploy
- [ ] Modify the subnet CIDR range
- [ ] Add a new domain user via Ansible

### Intermediate Challenges
- [ ] Create a new server type (e.g., Ubuntu instead of Debian)
- [ ] Implement custom security group rules
- [ ] Add additional storage volumes to servers
- [ ] Configure a simple web service on Linux servers

### Advanced Challenges
