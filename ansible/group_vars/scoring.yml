# ==============================================================================
# SCORING ENGINE CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
# This file configures the DWAYNE-INATOR-5000 scoring engine for your competition.
#
# WHAT IS A SCORING ENGINE?
# In Capture The Flag (CTF) and Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC)
# style events, a scoring engine automatically checks if services (like websites,
# email servers, etc.) are running correctly. Teams earn points when their
# services are up and working, and lose points when services go down.
#
# COMPETITION ROLES:
# - Grey Team: Runs the competition infrastructure (that's you!)
# - Blue Team: Defenders who keep services running and secure
# - Red Team: Attackers who try to break into Blue Team systems
#
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
# 1. Edit the settings below to match your competition
# 2. Run: ansible-playbook playbooks/setup-scoring-engine.yml
# 3. Access the web scoreboard at http://<scoring-server-ip>:8080
#
# ANSIBLE VARIABLES EXPLAINED:
# Variables defined here (like scoring_event_name) are automatically
# available in playbooks and templates. Ansible loads all .yml files
# from group_vars/ based on which hosts are being configured.
#
# DOCUMENTATION:
# - Ansible Variables: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html
# - DWAYNE-INATOR-5000: https://github.com/DSU-DefSec/DWAYNE-INATOR-5000
# ==============================================================================

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EVENT SETTINGS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Basic information about your competition.

# The name shown on the scoreboard
scoring_event_name: "CDT Attack/Defend Competition"

# Timezone for timestamps on the scoreboard
# Find yours at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
scoring_timezone: "America/New_York"

# Start with scoring paused? (true = paused, false = running immediately)
# TIP: Set to true so you can verify everything works before starting the clock
scoring_start_paused: true

# Show detailed information to competitors on the scoreboard
scoring_verbose: true

# Web interface port (default: 8080)
# Access scoreboard at: http://<server-ip>:8080
scoring_port: 8080

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TIMING SETTINGS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Control how often services are checked and how points are calculated.
#
# EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
# With delay=60 and timeout=10, the engine checks each service every ~60 seconds.
# If a service doesn't respond within 10 seconds, that check fails.
# After 5 failed checks (sla_threshold), the team gets an SLA violation penalty.

# Seconds between service checks (how often to test each service)
scoring_delay: 60

# Random variation added to delay (prevents predictable check timing)
# This stops teams from "gaming" the system by only having services up during checks
scoring_jitter: 5

# How long to wait for a service to respond before marking it as down
scoring_timeout: 10

# Points awarded for each successful service check
scoring_service_points: 10

# SLA = Service Level Agreement
# How many consecutive failed checks before triggering an SLA violation
# Think of it like "three strikes and you're out" but for service uptime
scoring_sla_threshold: 5

# Penalty points deducted for an SLA violation
scoring_sla_points: 10

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ADMIN ACCOUNTS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Admin users can:
# - View all team scores and detailed logs
# - Start/pause/reset the competition
# - Grade inject submissions (manual challenges)
#
# SECURITY NOTE: Change these passwords for real competitions!
# These are just defaults for lab/training use.

scoring_admins:
  - name: admin
    password: "ScoringAdmin123!"

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TEAMS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define the teams competing in your event.
#
# SINGLE TEAM MODE (this config):
# One Blue Team defends all the boxes. Good for training and practice.
#
# MULTI-TEAM MODE (advanced):
# Multiple Blue Teams each defend their own copy of the infrastructure.
# Requires separate network ranges per team (e.g., Team1: 10.10.1.x, Team2: 10.10.2.x)
#
# The 'id' field identifies the team. In multi-team setups, this replaces
# the 'x' in IP addresses (e.g., 10.10.x.21 becomes 10.10.1.21 for team "1")

scoring_teams:
  - id: "1"
    password: "BlueTeam123!"   # Teams use this to log in and change service passwords

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CREDENTIAL LISTS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define username/password combinations that the scoring engine uses to
# test services. These simulate real users trying to access services.
#
# WHY CREDENTIAL LISTS?
# The scoring engine needs to log into services (SSH, Windows, databases)
# to verify they're working. These credentials must match what's actually
# configured on the target systems.
#
# IMPORTANT FOR BLUE TEAMS:
# - Teams CAN change passwords during competition (to lock out attackers)
# - Teams CANNOT add new users or change usernames
# - When a team changes a password, they update it in the scoring web interface
#
# MULTIPLE LISTS:
# Different services may use different accounts. For example:
# - "domain_users" for regular user logins
# - "admins" for administrative access
# - "linux_users" for Linux-specific accounts

scoring_credlists:
  # Regular domain users (these are created by the create-domain-users.yml playbook)
  - name: "domain_users"
    usernames:
      - jdoe
      - asmith
      - bwilson
      - mjohnson
      - dlee
    default_password: "UserPass123!"

  # Windows Administrator account
  - name: "admins"
    usernames:
      - Administrator
    default_password: "Cyberrange123!"

  # Linux local user account (created by cloud-init during VM deployment)
  - name: "linux_users"
    usernames:
      - cyberrange
    default_password: "Cyberrange123!"

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BOX DEFINITIONS WITH CHECKS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A "box" is a server/computer that the scoring engine monitors.
# Each box has one or more "checks" that test if specific services are working.
#
# SUPPORTED CHECK TYPES:
# - ping:  Can we reach the server? (ICMP)
# - ssh:   Can we log into Linux via SSH?
# - winrm: Can we remotely manage Windows? (Windows Remote Management)
# - rdp:   Is Remote Desktop available?
# - smb:   Can we access Windows file shares?
# - dns:   Does the DNS server resolve names correctly?
# - web:   Is the website responding?
# - ftp:   Can we access FTP file transfers?
# - sql:   Can we query the database?
# - ldap:  Can we query the directory service?
# - smtp:  Can we send email?
# - imap:  Can we receive email?
# - tcp:   Is a specific port open?
# - vnc:   Is VNC remote desktop available?
#
# ANATOMY OF A CHECK:
#   - type: ssh                    # What kind of service to test
#     credlists: ["linux_users"]   # Which credentials to use (defined above)
#     port: 22                     # Optional: non-standard port
#

scoring_boxes:
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # DOMAIN CONTROLLER (dc01)
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # The Domain Controller is the "brain" of a Windows network. It handles:
  # - User authentication (Active Directory)
  # - DNS (translating names like "dc01.CDT.local" to IP addresses)
  # - Group policies and permissions
  #
  # If the DC goes down, users can't log in and the whole network suffers.
  # This makes it a high-value target for attackers AND a critical service
  # for defenders to protect.
  - name: "dc01"
    ip: "10.10.10.21"
    checks:
      # Basic connectivity - can we reach the server at all?
      - type: ping

      # Windows Remote Management - can we run commands remotely?
      # Used by administrators (and attackers!) to manage Windows servers
      - type: winrm
        credlists: ["admins"]

      # Remote Desktop Protocol - can users connect with a graphical interface?
      - type: rdp

      # Server Message Block - Windows file sharing
      # Tests if SMB port is listening (TCP check is more reliable)
      - type: tcp
        port: 445

      # Domain Name System - does name resolution work?
      # This check asks "what is the IP address of dc01.CDT.local?"
      # and verifies the answer is correct
      - type: dns
        records:
          - kind: "A"                    # A = Address record (name -> IP)
            domain: "dc01.CDT.local"     # The name to look up
            answer: ["10.10.10.21"]      # Expected IP address(es)

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # WINDOWS MEMBER SERVER (blue-win-2)
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # A "member server" is a Windows server that's joined to the domain
  # but isn't a Domain Controller. It might run applications, databases,
  # file shares, or other services.
  - name: "blue-win-2"
    ip: "10.10.10.22"
    checks:
      - type: ping
      - type: winrm
        credlists: ["admins"]
      - type: rdp

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # LINUX WEB SERVER (webserver)
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # This Linux server hosts a website. Web servers are common targets
  # because they're exposed to the network and often have vulnerabilities.
  - name: "webserver"
    ip: "10.10.10.31"
    checks:
      - type: ping

      # Secure Shell - remote command-line access to Linux
      - type: ssh
        credlists: ["linux_users"]

      # Web check - is the website responding?
      - type: web
        urls:
          - path: "/"           # Check the homepage
            status: 200         # HTTP 200 = "OK" (page loaded successfully)

      # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # FLAG CHECK (Attack/Defend)
      # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # This check awards points to Red Team when they've planted a valid flag.
      # Uses SSH to read the flag file and check if it contains the token.
      - type: ssh
        display: "flag"
        credlists: ["linux_users"]
        commands:
          - command: "cat /var/www/html/flag.txt 2>/dev/null || echo NOT_FOUND"
            contains: true
            output: "{{ red_team_token }}"

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # ADDITIONAL LINUX SERVER (blue-linux-2)
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Another Linux server for the Blue Team to defend.
  # Could host databases, applications, or other services.
  - name: "blue-linux-2"
    ip: "10.10.10.32"
    checks:
      - type: ping

      # Flag check for this box - uses SSH to read the flag file
      - type: ssh
        display: "flag"
        credlists: ["linux_users"]
        commands:
          - command: "cat /home/flag.txt 2>/dev/null || echo NOT_FOUND"
            contains: true
            output: "{{ red_team_token }}"

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FLAG SYSTEM CONFIGURATION (Attack/Defend Mechanics)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The flag system adds attack/defend mechanics to your competition!
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. Red Team compromises a box and plants a flag file containing the token
# 2. Scoring engine SSHes into boxes and checks if flag.txt contains the token
# 3. If the flag is valid, Red Team earns points!
# 4. Blue Team must hunt for and remove flag files
#
# This creates better competition dynamics:
# - Red Team must be STEALTHY, not destructive
# - Blue Team must HUNT for flags, not just keep services running
# - Breaking services hurts BOTH teams

# Red team token for flag validation
# This token must appear in flag files for Red Team to score points
# Change this for each competition!
red_team_token: "REDTEAM-CTF-2026"
