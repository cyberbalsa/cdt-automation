# GLOBAL VARIABLES - APPLY TO ALL HOSTS
# ==============================================================================
# These variables are available to every VM in the lab environment.
# Edit these to customize your domain and user accounts.
#
# HOW ANSIBLE VARIABLES WORK:
# 1. Variables defined here are loaded for ALL hosts
# 2. Group-specific variables (in other files) override these
# 3. Host-specific variables override group variables
# 4. Command-line variables (-e) override everything
#

# ACTIVE DIRECTORY DOMAIN CONFIGURATION
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These settings define your Windows domain.
#
# WHAT IS ACTIVE DIRECTORY?
# Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft's directory service that manages:
# - User accounts and passwords
# - Computer accounts
# - Group memberships
# - Security policies
#
# A "domain" is a collection of computers that share a common directory database.
# The "Domain Controller" (DC) is the server that runs AD services.

domain_name: CDT.local
# The fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
# Format: DOMAIN.extension (usually .local for labs)
# Users will log in as: username@CDT.local or CDT\username

domain_netbios_name: CDT
# The short (NetBIOS) name for the domain
# Used in older login format: CDT\username
# Must be 15 characters or fewer, no dots

# Domain administrator credentials
# These are used by Ansible to configure domain services
domain_admin_user: cyberrange
domain_admin_password: Cyberrange123!
# SECURITY NOTE: In production, NEVER hardcode passwords!
# Use Ansible Vault for secrets: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/index.html
# This is OK for isolated lab/competition environments only

# Safe mode password (for domain controller recovery)
# Required when promoting a server to domain controller
# Used to boot into Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM)
domain_safe_mode_password: Cyberrange123!

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DOMAIN USERS AND GROUPS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Users and groups to create in Active Directory.
# Customize this list for your competition scenario.
#
# Each user will be created with these properties and added to specified groups.
# This is a YAML list - each item starts with a dash (-).

domain_users:
  - username: jdoe
    firstname: John
    surname: Doe
    password: UserPass123!
    groups:
      - Domain Users        # Default group for all domain users
      - IT Staff            # Custom group (created below)
    # COMPETITION NOTE: Regular user, good for testing normal access

  - username: asmith
    firstname: Alice
    surname: Smith
    password: UserPass123!
    groups:
      - Domain Users
      - IT Staff
      - Domain Admins       # Makes Alice a domain administrator!
    # ATTACK TARGET: Domain Admin accounts are high-value targets
    # Red Team: Try to compromise this account
    # Blue Team: Monitor and protect this account

  - username: bwilson
    firstname: Bob
    surname: Wilson
    password: UserPass123!
    groups:
      - Domain Users
    # Regular user with minimal privileges

  - username: mjohnson
    firstname: Mary
    surname: Johnson
    password: UserPass123!
    groups:
      - Domain Users
      - Accounting
    # Department-specific user

  - username: dlee
    firstname: David
    surname: Lee
    password: UserPass123!
    groups:
      - Domain Users
      - Engineering
    # Department-specific user

# YAML LIST SYNTAX EXPLAINED:
# - The dash (-) starts a new list item
# - Indented keys belong to that item
# - Lists within lists (like groups) use the same dash syntax
#
# ADDING MORE USERS:
# Copy an existing block and modify:
#   - username: newuser
#     firstname: New
#     surname: User
#     password: SomePassword123!
#     groups:
#       - Domain Users

# Domain groups to create (beyond default groups)
# These are custom groups for your organization
domain_groups:
  - name: IT Staff
    scope: Global           # Global groups can contain users from this domain
    category: Security      # Security groups (for permissions) vs Distribution (email)
    description: Information Technology Staff

  - name: Accounting
    scope: Global
    category: Security
    description: Accounting Department

  - name: Engineering
    scope: Global
    category: Security
    description: Engineering Department

# GROUP SCOPES EXPLAINED:
# - Global: Can contain users from same domain, can be used in any domain
# - Domain Local: Can contain users from any domain, used only in this domain
# - Universal: Can contain users from any domain, used in any domain (more replication)
#
# For most cases, Global scope is appropriate.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# LINUX ADMINISTRATORS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Domain users who should have sudo (administrator) access on Linux machines.
# These users can run commands as root using 'sudo'.

linux_admins:
  - jdoe
  - asmith

# COMPETITION NOTE:
# - These users can elevate privileges on Linux systems
# - Great for privilege escalation practice
# - Red Team: Compromise these accounts for Linux admin access
# - Blue Team: Monitor sudo usage in /var/log/auth.log

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DNS AND NETWORK
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DNS settings for domain resolution.
# The domain controller becomes the DNS server for the domain.

# DNS server is typically the domain controller's internal IP
# This is set dynamically in playbooks based on the DC's actual IP
# Uncomment to override:
# dns_server: 10.10.10.21

# HOW DNS WORKS IN A DOMAIN:
# 1. The DC runs DNS server for the domain (CDT.local)
# 2. All domain members point their DNS to the DC
# 3. The DC resolves internal names (dc01.CDT.local)
# 4. The DC forwards external queries (google.com) to internet DNS

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS (OUs)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Optional: Organize domain objects into OUs for a more realistic structure.
# OUs are containers in AD that group objects logically.
#
# Uncomment and customize if you want a more complex AD structure:
# domain_ous:
#   - name: Servers
#     path: DC=CDT,DC=local
#   - name: Workstations
#     path: DC=CDT,DC=local
#   - name: Users
#     path: DC=CDT,DC=local
#   - name: IT
#     path: OU=Users,DC=CDT,DC=local

# ==============================================================================
# CUSTOMIZING FOR YOUR COMPETITION
# ==============================================================================
#
# 1. CHANGE THE DOMAIN NAME:
#    - Update domain_name and domain_netbios_name
#    - Example: domain_name: HOSPITAL.local
#
# 2. ADD MORE USERS:
#    - Add entries to domain_users list
#    - Give them realistic names for your scenario
#    - Vary the group memberships
#
# 3. CREATE CUSTOM GROUPS:
#    - Add entries to domain_groups list
#    - Example for a hospital: Doctors, Nurses, Administrators, IT
#
# 4. SET UP SERVICE ACCOUNTS:
#    - Create users for services (SQL, web apps, etc.)
#    - These are targets for Kerberoasting attacks!
#
# EXAMPLE SERVICE ACCOUNT:
#   - username: svc_sql
#     firstname: SQL
#     surname: Service
#     password: ServicePass123!
#     groups:
#       - Domain Users
